# Day1: Practice

  1. Go to https://github.com/.
  
  2. Signup/Signin.
  
  ### Practice: Add a new project to GitHub repo. i.e., add you local project to github server.

      1. Crate a new repository in GitHub. 
      
        Note:
          1. Download the git scm from https://git-scm.com/ which is the client to communicate with the serevr GitHub.com.
          2. Download the tortoiseGit from https://tortoisegit.org/ (this is also a git client, try this. Restart your machine if you don't see the colors on the local repo folders/files.)
          3. DO NOT clone any repository on desktop or directly under C driver or under username. Create new folder, give meaning name and then clone git repo.

      2. Clone the GitHub repo to your local machine. (using any client Git bash, TortoiseGit, or your favorite git client source tree, GitHub Desktop etc)

        Syntax: git clone <gitURL> <destinationPath>

        Ex: git clone https://github.com/venkatasykam/FirstJavaProject.git <destinationPath>

      3. Configure username & emailid.
      
          git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
          git config --global user.name "Your Name"

      4. Add the new files/code to repo.

        Syantax: git add <fileName>  OR git add .

        Ex: git add MyFirstJava.java

      5. Commit to local repo.

        Syntax: git commit -m "commit message"

        Ex: git commit -m "adding my first project"

      6. Push the commits to server.

        Syntax: git push

        ex: git push
        
        
 # Bitbucket & GitLab
 
      Practice the same above steps with Bitbucket https://bitbucket.org/ and GitLab https://gitlab.com/ (This is the similar tool to GitHub).
      
      Parallelly you can learn both the tools since operations(git commands & worlflow, branching, merging, tagging etc) wise both are same.


# Covered topics
